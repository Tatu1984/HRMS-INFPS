## üîó VERIFY AUTOMATIC ACCOUNTING INTEGRATION

**This is the KEY FEATURE you requested!**

### Test Workflow:
1. Go to Sales page
2. Create a new sale with:
   - Quantity: 10
   - Unit Price: 10,000
   - Discount: 5,000
   - Tax: 18%
3. **CHECK "Sync to Accounts"** ‚Üê IMPORTANT!
4. Create the sale
5. Go to Accounts page
6. **‚úÖ VERIFY**: You see TWO entries:
   - **Gross Amount**: ‚Çπ100,000 (10 √ó 10,000)
   - **Net Amount**: ‚Çπ111,900 (after -5,000 discount + 18% tax)
7. Both entries reference the sale number (SL00001)

**Calculation Breakdown**:
```
Gross Amount    = 10 √ó ‚Çπ10,000      = ‚Çπ100,000
After Discount  = ‚Çπ100,000 - ‚Çπ5,000 = ‚Çπ95,000
Tax Amount      = ‚Çπ95,000 √ó 18%     = ‚Çπ17,100
Net Amount      = ‚Çπ95,000 + ‚Çπ17,100 = ‚Çπ112,100
```
